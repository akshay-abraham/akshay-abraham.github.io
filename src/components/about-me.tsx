        I am currently a Class 11 PCMB student at Girideepam Bethany Central School, pursuing a path toward theoretical physics. Alongside academics, I have been actively working with electronics and technology for over three years—ranging from practical electrical work in my neighborhood to building with Arduino, ESP boards, and sensors. I have experience with C, Python, and command-line tools like Git. At school, I have consistently taken up leadership roles since Class 9, including serving on the student council and as a Prefect, which has honed my ability to take responsibility, collaborate, and stay disciplined in group efforts. My goal is to develop skills in a real working environment and learn from people building in technology.
